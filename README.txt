When waiting for the URI http://hoopladada.github.io/ to display the changes made, I waited over an hour but that URI never displayed my website. I have commented out the line that redirects http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~ngonza01/ to http://hoopladada.github.io/ . As a result, my website is displayed on http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~ngonza01/ and nowhere else. I'm sorry.

For this assignment I attempted several strategies with regards to styling that ended up being a bit more complicated than I had anticipated. For example, I intended on making my resume much fancier. In the end, I went with a very simple style for each page. Most of my questions were answered by stackoverflow.

When desperately in need of help, I consulted Will Clarkson. WHen attempting to commit, I continually got the message:

 "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details."

When Will was able to fix this for me, I was already done with the assignment. As a result, I beleive I only have one commit. 

Will also tried very hard to figure out why the changes in the hoopladada.github.io repository weren't displayed and advised me to comment out the code that redirected because he also did not know what was going on.

I spent an estimate of seven hours on this assignment. Maybe more.
