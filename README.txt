For this assignment I attempted several strategies with regards to styling that ended up being a bit more complicated than I had anticipated. For example, I intended on making my resume much fancier. In the end, I went with a very simple style for each page. Most of my questions were answered by stackoverflow.

When desperately in need of help, I consulted Will Clarkson. WHen attempting to commit, I continually got the message:

 "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details."

When Will was able to fix this for me, I was already done with the assignment. As a result, I beleive I only have one commit.

I spent an estimate of seven hours on this assignment. Maybe more.
